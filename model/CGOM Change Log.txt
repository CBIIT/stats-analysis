Changes from version 1.63 to 1.64:

Added the ClinicalLeukemiaFinding object to the gov.nih.nci.caintegrator.domain.finding.clinical.leukemia package.

Changes from 1.64 to 1.65:

Added a Reporter object.  Both GeneExprReporter and VariationReporter extend this object.

Changes from 1.65 to 1.66:

1. Changed directionality between SNPAssociationAnalysis and study from Source -> Destination, to Bi-Directional
2. Added id (datatype Long)in SpecimenBasedFinding object, removed the id (datatype Long) from SpecimenBasedMolecularFinding object for now,
   once all the ids have been changed to Long data type, then will move the id to the super class: Finding.
3. Changed the assocation direction from SomaticMutationAnnotation to GeneBiomarker from "Unspecified" to "Source-> Destination"
4. Changed the assocation btwn SNPPanel to SNPAssay from uni-directional to bi-directional.
5. Changed the following object’s id attribute from String to Long: SNPAnnotation, BACCloneReporter,VariationReporter

Changes from 1.66 to 1.67:

1. Created target object diagram.
2. Added the assocation btwn VariationReporter to SNPAnnotation.
3. Changed all the ClinicalAssessment return packge to clinical from domain in the the LeukemiaClinicalFinding object.

Changes from 1.67 to 1.68:

Add association from StudyParticipant to Histology

Changed from 1.68 to 1.69:

Added eagle objects, including everything in the epidemiology package
Added association from StudyParticipant to EpidemiologyFinding
Added height and weight to StudyParticipant
Added OddsRatio object
